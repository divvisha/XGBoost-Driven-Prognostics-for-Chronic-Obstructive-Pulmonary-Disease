# XGBoost-Driven-Prognostics-for-Chronic-Obstructive-Pulmonary-Disease
The project aims to develop a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict the risk of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) based on patient data, such as genetic markers and demographics.It will involve data preprocessing, feature selection, and training the model for accurate predictions. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision, with a focus on identifying key factors influencing COPD.

## About
This project leverages XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to develop a predictive model for COPD progression. XGBoost is renowned for its efficiency and accuracy in handling high-dimensional data and complex interactions between features. In this system, both genetic data, such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and clinical data, including patient history and breathing patterns, are used to predict the likelihood of COPD progression. These data-driven insights provide a more personalized prognosis, helping clinicians make more informed decisions.

## Features
1. Integrates diverse health data from EHRs, wearables, and environmental sources.
2. Cleans and processes data for accurate machine learning analysis.
3. Uses advanced algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, RNNs) for precise COPD predictions.
4. Predicts exacerbation risk, severity, and readmission likelihood.
5. Offers real-time monitoring through wearable device data.
6. Personalizes treatment suggestions based on individual risk factors.
7. Evaluates impact of environmental and social factors on COPD progression.
8. Ensures robust performance through rigorous model validation.

## Requirements
1. Data Collection: Patient records, environmental data, demographics, optional wearable data.
2. Data Storage: Secure database for storing patient and environmental data.
3. Data Processing Tools: Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data handling.
4. Machine Learning Framework: Tools like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for model training.
5. Server or Cloud Support: For handling large data and model computation.
6. Model Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning for accurate predictions.
7. Testing: Data split and cross-validation for accurate model performance.

## Results
The output of the COPD prediction system provides two key results: a prediction indicating whether the user has COPD ("has COPD" or "does not have COPD"), and the probability of having COPD based on the input data. The accuracy of the prediction is derived from the trained XGBoost model, and the result is presented along with a probability score to quantify the likelihood of COPD. This output is displayed in a straightforward manner for easy interpretation by users.
